# sie-placement

Versioned documents for a measured-only placement planner: the service level
each served identity must meet, the measurements a placement may be chosen
from, the prices those placements cost, the demand they serve, and the plan
that results. The package uses only the Python standard library. It is a
workspace package and is not published to PyPI.

A served identity is a model id or a `model:profile` pair, the routing key a
request resolves to. A measurement cell is a machine profile together with the
GPU product the measurement actually ran on, such as the
`nvidia.com/gpu.product` node label value `NVIDIA-L4`. Recording the realized
product rather than the requested one keeps a measurement taken on different
silicon from standing in for the profile it was requested on.

## Documents

Every document is a JSON object with a `kind` and a `schemaVersion`. Readers
reject another kind, any version other than `1`, unknown fields, `null`
values, booleans where numbers are expected and non-finite numbers. Errors
name the offending field by its JSON path, for example
`$.lanes[1].envelope.floorMax: must not exceed maxContainers (2), got 3`.

| Kind | Type | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `placement-service-levels` | `ServiceLevels` | Optional named `tiers` and the `identities` that declare or inherit service levels |
| `placement-receipt` | `Receipt` | One throughput and latency measurement of one identity on one cell, container shape, concurrency and request shape |
| `placement-boot-evidence` | `BootEvidence` | One measured boot, snapshot restore or resident load of one identity on one cell and container shape |
| `placement-price-list` | `PriceList` | Accelerator, core and memory rates per machine profile, and the region multiplier per placement |
| `placement-demand` | `Demand` | Hourly request counts per identity and operation over a UTC window |
| `placement-plan` | `Plan` | Lanes with their cell, container shape, concurrency, ceiling and envelope, and the lane and warmth of every identity |

Each type parses with `from_dict(data)` and serializes with `to_dict()`.
Constructing a type in code applies the same rules as parsing it:

```python
import json

from sie_placement.schema import Plan

with open("plan.json", encoding="utf-8") as handle:
    plan = Plan.from_dict(json.load(handle))
assert Plan.from_dict(plan.to_dict()) == plan
```

## Operations

Receipts and demand name the primitive a lane runs: `encode`, `score`,
`extract` or `generate`. Gateway telemetry labels requests by route and
already reports the generation and transcription routes as `generate` and
`extract`. An adapter folds the remaining route labels the same way:
`embeddings`, the OpenAI-compatible route that the gateway rewrites into an
encode request, counts as `encode`; `moderations` answers 501 without serving
a model, so it carries no demand to place; `other` names no primitive and is
not assigned to one.

## Service levels

An identity declares the fields below, or inherits them from the tier it
names. Fields it declares override the tier's.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `comeAliveP95S` | Seconds from a request for an idle identity to its first result, at the 95th percentile. `0` means never cold |
| `warmP99Ms` | Warm latency at the 99th percentile, at the receipt's request shape |
| `ttftP99Ms`, `itlP99Ms` | Time to first token and inter-token latency at the 99th percentile. A generation identity declares both instead of `warmP99Ms` |
| `queueWaitP99Ms` | Time a request may wait for capacity under load, at the 99th percentile |

## Warmth

A plan gives every identity one warmth: `pinned`, `cold-with-bound`,
`bridged`, `snapshot-cold`, `scheduled-warm` or `lazy-resident`. A `pinned` or
`lazy-resident` identity sits on a lane whose envelope keeps `floorMin` at 1
or more; every other warmth sits on a lane whose `floorMin` is 0. Boot
evidence records `cold-with-bound` boots, `snapshot-cold` restores and
`lazy-resident` loads, with outcome `succeeded`, `failed` or `timed-out`.

## Lanes

A plan lane carries the three tokens that name a lane of the `sie-cluster`
Helm chart: `queuePool`, the `machineProfile` of its `cell`, and `bundle`.
`queuePool` is the physical queue pool the lane's workers consume:
`workers.common.queuePool` (`default`), or a worker group's `queuePool`
override. It is neither the `workers.pools` map key, which names a worker
group, nor an SDK logical pool. `bundle` is a key of that worker group's
`bundles` map. `name` is the lane's handle inside the plan, and each identity
refers to its lane by that name.

## Envelope

A plan lane's envelope bounds what an online tuner may change without a new
plan. `floorMin` and `floorMax` are required, with `floorMax` at most the
lane's `maxContainers`. `bufferMin` with `bufferMax`, and
`scaledownWindowMinS` with `scaledownWindowMaxS`, are optional pairs for
platforms that can move a warm buffer or a scale-down window per lane.
